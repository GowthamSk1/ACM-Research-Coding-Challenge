## Question One

![Image of Cluster Plot](ClusterPlot.png)
<br/>
Given the following dataset in `ClusterPlot.csv`, determine the number of clusters by using any clustering algorithm. **You're allowed to use any Python library you want to implement this**, just document which ones you used in this README file. Try to complete this as soon as possible.

Regardless if you can or cannot answer the question, provide a short explanation of how you got your solution or how you think it can be solved in your README.md file.
